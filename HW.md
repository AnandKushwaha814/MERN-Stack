## 1. What is `Emmet` ?
* Emmet is a tool that makes coding faster and more fun, especially when you're building web pages!
* Saves Time: You write less, and Emmet writes more for you.
- Time-Saver:
* Less Mistakes: Since Emmet writes the code, you make fewer mistakes.
## 2. Difference between a `Library and Framework` ?
### Library
* A library is a collection of reusable code that provides a specific functionality or set of functionalities.
* Libraries are typically used to perform a specific task
* React

### Framework
* It is a set of pre-defined components, tools, and rules that govern how an application is built. Frameworks are typically used to build applications that require a specific architecture or design pattern.

* React = Library: Youâ€™re in control, and you use React like a toolkit to build your app.
* Framework = Framework: The framework is in control, and it tells you how to build your app

## 3. What is `CDN` ? why do we `use` it ?
* CDN stands for `Content Delivery Network`. It is a network that helps to speed up web page loading for web users by distributing content across different servers located in various geographic locations.
* A CDN is a network of servers that helps deliver website content faster and more reliably by serving it from the closest server to the user. It improves load times, reduces the burden on your main server, and enhances the overall user experience.

* Faster Loading Times:
* Reduced Server Load:
* Improved Reliability:
* Better User Experience:
* Security:
### 4. Why Is `React known as React` ?
* React is known as React due to its ability to "react" to changes in the application state. The name was chosen by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who developed the initial version of the library.
* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.
* React is known as React due to its ability to efficiently react to changes in the application state, making it a powerful and scalable solution for building user interfaces.

### 5. What is `crossorgin in script tag` ?
* The `crossorigin` attribute in a script tag is used to specify how the browser should handle cross-origin requests for scripts. Cross-origin requests occur when a web page requests a resource from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one the web page was loaded from.

* the `crossorigin` attribute in a script tag is used to specify how the browser should handle cross-origin requests for scripts. It can have two values: `anonymous` and `use-credentials`. You should use this attribute with caution and only when necessary, as it can increase the risk of XSS attacks.

### 6. What is difference `between React and ReactDOM` ?
* React and ReactDOM are two separate libraries that work together to enable building and rendering React applications in the browser. While React provides the core functionality for building user interfaces, ReactDOM provides the necessary glue layer to render and update React components in the browser's DOM.

* React is the library you use to build and define UI components.
* ReactDOM is the library that allows those components to be rendered and interact with the DOM in web browsers.
They work together to build web applications, with React focusing on the components and ReactDOM focusing on getting those components onto the web page.
